        <header><h1>Yanna's Favorite Bands</h1></header>
        <p>Hey, this is Yanna writing.<br>
        My favorite thing in the whole world is <strong>MUSIC</strong>.<br>
        So that was my first thought when I knew I had to create a page about something.<br></p>
        <h2>Ok... But why do you like music so much?</h2>
        <p>Well, I feel like the songs I listen to helps me to process emotions better.<br>
        It doesn't really matter if it's a sad or a happy moment, listening to the right song always makes me feel calmer and puts my thoughts in the right place.<br>
        So here I've selected my three favorite bands and some songs that are very special for me.</p>
        <h2>My top 3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://paramore.net/#home" target="_blank">Paramore</a><br>
                <img src="EH.jpg" alt="Blurry photo of a guitarist and drummer playing." style="width:200px;height:300px;"><br>
            Paramore's been a band that I've been listening to since I don't know when, their lyrics remind me of my teenager years and also a bunch of new feelings as an adult.
            Some of my favorite songs are: When It Rains, Playing God, Last Hope, Idle Worship and Thick Skull</li>
            <li><a href="https://foofighters.com" target="_blank">Foo Fighters</a><br>
                <img src="FF.jpg" alt="Album's covers on the wall, focus on Foo Fighters Greatest Hits." style="width:200px;height:300px;"><br>
            Foo Fighters is a band I started listening as a teenager and the album The Colour and The Shape specifically is really meaningful to me.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.houseofprotectionmusic.com" target="_blank">House of Protection</a><br>
                <img src="HoP.jpg" alt="Singer in the background and a hand making the sign of the horns typical in rock concerts." style="width:200px;height:300px;"><br>
            House of Protection is a band I started listening when I got here in the US, I've been listening to them nonstop and I went to see them live in Maryland.</li>
        </ul>
